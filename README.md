## DDD Template
This repository contains a template for building applications using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It serves as a starting point for developers who want to follow DDD practices and build software systems that align closely with the business domain.

### Features
Ubiquitous Language: The template encourages the use of a shared language between domain experts and developers to ensure clear communication and understanding.

Bounded Contexts: The template supports breaking down complex domains into smaller bounded contexts, each with its own domain model and language.

Domain Models: It provides a foundation for creating rich domain models that accurately represent the core concepts, behavior, and rules of the business domain.

Aggregates: The template demonstrates the concept of aggregates, which are clusters of related domain objects treated as a single unit to enforce consistency and encapsulate business rules.

Domain Events: It showcases how to handle domain events, which represent significant changes or occurrences within the domain and can trigger actions in other parts of the system.

Continuous Collaboration: The template emphasizes ongoing collaboration between domain experts and developers to refine the domain model and ensure that the software meets business needs.
